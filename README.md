# Python-Instacart-Portfolio
## Project Summary
This portfolio presents a detailed exploratory analysis of Instacart’s sales data, aimed at revealing meaningful trends in customer purchasing behavior. The objective is to generate data-driven insights that guide more precise marketing decisions. This project investigates major business questions raised by the sales and marketing teams such as identifying peak shopping periods, analyzing spending habits and determining which products perform best within each department. It also includes customer segmentation to uncover behavioral differences across factors like brand loyalty, region, age, income and family status. These findings support Instacart in designing more personalized marketing campaigns, increasing sales efficiency and improving the targeting of promotions and advertisements.
